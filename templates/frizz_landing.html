          Frizz Wiz uses concepts found in The Curly Girl Method.
          If you're interested in learning more about The Curly Girl Method, I recommend you
          buy the book through Amazon.

        <h3>What is a The Curly Girl Method?</h3>
        The Curly Girl Method is an approach to hair care designed by author Lorraine Massey for natural hair (coils, waves, and curls) that has not been chemically relaxed.
        This method discourages the daily use of sulfate shampoo, which is considered too harsh for curly hair.
        Among other things, it calls for the use of a cleansing conditioner in place of shampoo (also called "conditioner washing" or "co-washing"),
        no silicones (used in many commercial conditioners and styling products), the use of a diffuser when blowdrying, and no combs, brushes, or
        terrycloth towels. It also includes tips for using hair gel and other styling products. The aim in general is to treat naturally curly hair gently,
        minimizing damage to the hair cuticle; to keep it moisturized, since curly hair is more prone to dryness than straight hair; and, perhaps most significantly,
        to accentuate rather than interfere with the hair's natural curl pattern. The Andre Walker Hair Typing System and Fia's hair typing system groups curly
        types from 2 to 4 and A to C (representing increasing tightness of the curl) with type 1 representing the complete absence of curl (or straight hair).
        Type 2 typically encompasses varying degrees of wavy hair, Type 3 contains loose, spiraled curls, and Type 4 includes tighter curls, kinks, and coils.
        Type A tends to be less defined than B and C, and when going from A to C the hair is more likely to be well-defined.

        <h3>Where can I learn more?</h3>
    <p>
        Not interested in reading? I get it. The handbook is great but if you don't have time, you can learn more
        about the method by visiting the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curly_Girl_Method#:~:text=Among%20other%20things%2C%20it%20calls,%2C%20brushes%2C%20or%20terrycloth%20towels"
                                            target="_blank">Curly Girl Method Wikipedia page</a>.
        Or you can google curly girl and get lot's of great information - all for free! I am biased but if you are
        serious about your hair, I recommend the book.*

        <h3>What the heck is a Humectant?</h3>
        <p>Basically any substance that attracts water. You can find humectants in shampoos, conditioners, lotions, and other products.
